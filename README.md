This was a project I worked on during Spring 2024. It chose to utilize MATLAB for its relatively simple practices with matrices. 
The project itself is based on queing theory and uses matrices to model cars waiting in line at their respective pick up/drop off locations. 
The goal of the code was to find a point at which time of a car waiting in line becomes exponential rather than linear due to a build up in cars from a slow pick up process. 
Running the code in MATLAB will produce a graph which illustrates this breaking point by creating an exponential and linear line.
